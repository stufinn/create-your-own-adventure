Well, looks like the end of a long and beautiful empire.
(Insert name of politician you don't like) has won. What do you do?

Alright. You're ready. 
Let's head off to the [true north strong and free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yFs7K27kZI).

Make sure to brush up on your English: it's [zed, not zee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRI-A3vakVg).

Perhaps [applying for status as a political refugee](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/outside/index.asp) 
would be one way to go?

Or maybe you work in a [NAFTA profession](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/special-business.asp)?

Thinking about marrying that cute Canadian student 
who sits next to you in class to get away from all this chaos? 
[Sorry buddy, I've got bad news](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=357&top=5).

No dice? Yikes. 
Guess you'll have to stick around and 
[enjoy all this freedom](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/damn-right-im-free-this-is-america.png), eh?

BUT WAIT!  There's one more option. There is ALWAYS another option. Elon Musk has just tweeted that YOU have won
a free trip to Mars. The only catch is, this is the first manned flight and not all of the rocket's kinks have 
been ironed out. What's you're decision?

"Eff yeah, I'm riding a rocket to the red plant to live out the rest of my sols! [Sign me up!](../spacex/spacex_rocket.md)"

"NO WAY, there is a high probablity that the procket is going to blow up before we ever get there and even if we 
make it to Mars, the planet's radiation is going to kill me anyway. I'm staying. Count me out, I'm just going 
to [bake some cookies](../bake-cookies/cookies.md) here on Earth."
