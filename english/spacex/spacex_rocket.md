As you are rocketing out of Earth's atmosphere and into the black starry night, toward that distant twinkling red flicker, 
a single tear floats away from your eye and seeps into the edge of the touchscreen panel in front of you. This seeminlgy 
minor event causes a subtle electrical issue that ends up affecting the trajectory of the ship. You are now en route 
to Jupiter's moon Io instead, where you will live out your final days, wandering among the moon's many volcanoes.  

Sorry!
